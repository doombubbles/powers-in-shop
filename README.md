Powers in Shop

</h1>

### Adds many of the Monkey Money Powers to the in-game shop for purchase with normal currency.

This includes all Tower-based Powers: Monkey Farmer (\$500), Tech Bot (\$375), Portable Lake (\$500), Pontoon (\$450)
and Energising Totem (\$1000); as well as the Track-based Powers: Road Spikes (\$50), Glue Trap (\$500),
Camo Trap (\$600), Moab Mine (\$2000), and Cave Monkey (\750). Super Monkey Storm, Monkey Boost, Thrive, and Time Stop
are included but must be manually enabled in settings.

Also includes the new Powers Pro: Banana Farmer Pro ($1000), Super Monkey Beacon (\$4000).
Powers Pro towers and upgrades aren't automatically unlocked, you need to have earned their real power counterparts
legitimately.

The costs of all these towers are configurable, with the defaults shown above. Prices can be set to a negative number to
remove them from the shop. The pierces for the Track-based powers (all normal by default except for Moab Mine--changed
to 1), as is the Recharge Cost and Attack Speed of the Energising Totem ($500 and 15% down from 25%, by default).

Also configurable are allowing the Power Towers in CHIMPS mode (defaults to false) and restricting them in
Primary/Military/Magic Only mode towers (defaults to true).
