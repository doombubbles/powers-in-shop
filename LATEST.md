- Added Powers Pro to Shop
    - Banana Farmer Pro (\$1000)
    - Super Monkey Beacon (\$4000)
    - You still have to unlock Powers Pro and their upgrades normally to be able to buy them from the shop
- Some power default costs have been changed to reflect the costs established for the powers within Rogue Legends /
  changes the powers have received
    - Pontoon -> \$450
    - Portable Lake -> \$500
    - Tech Bot -> \$375
    - Glue Trap -> \$500
    - Camo Trap -> \$600
    - Moab Mine -> \$2000 (Pierce still modified to 1 by default)
- Added the Cave Monkey to the shop, with a cost of \$750
- Implemented most of the remaining powers, but due to the inherit imbalance of having them in the shop, they are all
  disabled by default via having their costs set to -1 in settings. To use them in game you will need to change this to
  whatever you deem is an appropriate cost.
